# Fake_CVE-2020-1350
This is the source code for a very crude fake CVE-2020-1350 exploit tool, which developed as part of [honeypot repository](https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-135) for the SIGRed vulnerability, with the goal of tracking/mapping interest and attempts to use exploits for this critical vulnerability.  This project was spontaneously launched by [ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish).

**This executable does not perform any exploits or malicious activity.**

The sole actions performed by this code are as follows:

* On launch, an HTTP GET request is sent to a CanaryToken from thinkst's [CanaryTokens.org](https://canarytokens.org). [More Info](https://blog.thinkst.com/p/canarytokensorg-quick-free-detection.html)
* The GUI contains a single label, text box, and button.
* The text box is intended for an IP and is labeled as such
* When the submit button is pressed, the input is checked for a valid IP.
  * If the input is valid, a second check is performed to see if the input is 127.0.0.1
    * If the input is 127.0.0.1, an error message is displayed ridiculing you for targeting yourself and then continues regardless of Yes/No selection.
    * If the input is NOT 127.0.0.1, no alert is displayed
  * If the input is not valid, the input field is cleared and an alert is displayed stating that the input was not a valid IP
* Once validation passes, the script launches Internet Explorer in 'kiosk' mode pointed to a [Kermit the Frong version of Rick Astley's legendary hit *Never Gonna Give You Up*](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AyOqGRjVtls?autoplay=1&controls=0).
